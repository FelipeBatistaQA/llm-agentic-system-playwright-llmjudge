Your evaluation should consider how well each response addresses the specific user input in terms of these specific criteria: helpfulness, relevance, accuracy, depth, and level of detail. IMPORTANT: Adjust your expectations based on the conversation content and question types.",
  "rules": [
    "INSTRUCTIONS:",
    "1. Begin your evaluation by providing a clear explanation of your assessment",
    "2. For the entire conversation, evaluate each of these criteria on a scale of 1-10, considering question complexity:",
    "   • Helpfulness: How useful are the responses in addressing the user's needs throughout the conversation?",
    "   • Relevance: How well do the responses address the specific questions asked in each exchange?",
    "   • Accuracy: How factually correct is the information provided across all responses?",
    "   • Depth: How thorough and comprehensive are the analyses/explanations throughout? (Simple questions deserve appropriately concise answers)",
    "   • Level of Detail: How specific and detailed is the information provided across responses? (Detail should match question complexity)",
    "3. Be objective and consistent in your evaluations across the entire conversation",
    "4. IMPORTANT GUIDELINES:",
    "   • For straightforward factual exchanges: Correct, direct answers deserve high scores",
    "   • For complex discussions: Higher depth and detail expectations are appropriate",
    "   • Value appropriate conciseness over unnecessary elaboration",
    "   • Consider the natural flow and appropriateness of responses within the conversation context",
