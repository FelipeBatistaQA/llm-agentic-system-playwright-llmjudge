    "   • 7-8: Good - Generally accurate and helpful responses with minor issues in addressing user inputs", 
    "   • 5-6: Satisfactory - Responses are correct but may lack clarity or completeness in addressing what was asked",

    "{\"explanation\": \"The assistant correctly identifies the main geographical regions of Brazil in the first response, then accurately explains which region contains the Amazon and provides the correct percentage when asked. Both responses directly address the user inputs with factual information and appropriate detail.\", \"rating\": 9}",
    "{\"explanation\": \"The assistant provides generally correct information but the responses lack depth. While the first answer about mountain ranges is accurate, the second response about formation only partially addresses the geological processes question, missing key details.\", \"rating\": 5}",
    "{\"explanation\": \"The assistant failed to properly address the user inputs. The first response about climate zones is mostly irrelevant to the question, and the second response contains factual errors. Neither response adequately addresses what the user specifically asked.\", \"rating\": 2}"
