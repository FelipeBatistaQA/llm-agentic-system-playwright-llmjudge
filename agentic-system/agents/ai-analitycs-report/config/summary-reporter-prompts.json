  "rules": [
    "INSTRUCTIONS:",
    "1. Create a comprehensive yet concise analysis using ALL detailed metrics provided",
    "2. Adapt language complexity based on the results:",
    "   • Excellent results (>8.5 avg): Brief, confident summary highlighting perfect scores",
    "   • Good results (6.5-8.5): Balanced analysis with minor recommendations", 
    "   • Concerning results (4.5-6.5): Detailed analysis with clear action items",
    "   • Poor results (<4.5): Thorough investigation with urgent recommendations",
    "3. INCORPORATE DETAILED ANALYSIS:",
    "   • Mention perfectCriteria explicitly (e.g., 'Perfect Relevance and Accuracy scores')",
    "   • Use ratingRange data for precision (e.g., 'ratings span 9.2-9.8')",
    "   • Reference detailedRatingAnalysis for distribution insights",
    "   • Include dataQuality issues if found",
    "   • Note standardDeviation for consistency assessment",
    "4. Structure your analysis:",
    "   • Overall assessment: One clear classification considering perfect criteria",
    "   • Executive summary: 2-3 sentences with specific numerical insights",
    "   • Key findings: Include perfect scores, rating consistency, and standout metrics",
    "   • Performance highlights: Emphasize perfect criteria and narrow variance if positive",
    "   • Areas of concern: Note any criteria below 9.0, data quality issues, or evaluation bias",
    "   • Recommendations: Specific, actionable next steps based on exact findings",
    "5. SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:",
    "   • Always mention perfect 10.0 criteria scores in highlights",
    "   • Use exact decimal ranges instead of approximations",
    "   • If rating range < 1.0, address potential evaluation calibration",
    "   • Include standard deviation context for consistency",
    "6. Include confidence level (1-10) in your assessment",
    "7. If anomalies are detected, incorporate them with specific numerical context",
    "8. Return results in JSON format with the exact schema provided"

  "examples": [
    "For avgRating: 9.52, perfectCriteria: ['relevance', 'accuracy'], ratingRange: 0.6: 'Exceptional performance with perfect Relevance and Accuracy scores. The 0.6-point rating range (9.2-9.8) indicates remarkably consistent quality.'",
    "For standardDeviation: 0.18, mostFrequentRating: {value: 9.6, percentage: 50}: 'Highly consistent evaluation with 50% of tests achieving 9.6 rating and minimal variance (σ=0.18).'",
    "For dataQuality.invalidEntriesFound: 2: 'Strong overall performance, though 2 invalid data entries were detected and excluded from analysis.'"
