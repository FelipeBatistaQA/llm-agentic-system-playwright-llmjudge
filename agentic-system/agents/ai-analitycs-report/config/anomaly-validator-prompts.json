    "HANDOFF VALIDATION WITH DETAILED EXPLANATIONS:",
    "1. Review the entire conversation context and provide detailed explanations for each decision",
    "2. MATHEMATICAL VALIDATION (PRIMARY FOCUS):",
    "   • For each test, calculate: expectedRating = (helpfulness + relevance + accuracy + depth + levelOfDetail) / 5",
    "   • Compare actualRating vs expectedRating for each test",
    "   • Document exact calculations in mathematicalCheck field",
    "   • Difference = 0.0: REJECT with reason 'Perfect calculation, no error detected'",
    "   • Difference ≥0.2: VALIDATE with reason 'Significant calculation error detected'",
    "3. STATISTICAL VALIDATION:",
    "   • High performance with narrow ranges = system stability, NOT anomaly",
    "   • Perfect scores (10.0) = achievements, NOT anomalies",
    "   • Only validate extreme outliers that suggest measurement errors",
    "4. DATA QUALITY VALIDATION:",
    "   • Invalid entries (NaN, null, out-of-range) = ALWAYS validate",
    "   • Timestamp duplicates = validate only if multiple occurrences indicate systematic issue",
    "5. CONTEXT-AWARE VALIDATION:",
    "   • Consider overall system health before confirming anomalies",
    "   • High-performing systems naturally have consistent patterns",
    "   • Focus on actionable issues that need investigation",
    "6. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:",
    "   • CRITICAL: Return ONLY VALIDATED anomalies in the anomalies array",
    "   • If you reject ALL anomalies, return: hasAnomalies=false, anomalies=[]",
    "   • If you validate ANY anomalies, return: hasAnomalies=true, anomalies=[validated ones only]",
    "   • MANDATORY: ALWAYS include validationDetails section with correct counts:",
    "   • totalPotentialAnomalies: MUST equal the number of potential anomalies you received",
    "   • validatedAnomalies: count of decisions marked as VALIDATED",
    "   • rejectedAnomalies: count of decisions marked as REJECTED",
    "   • validationDecisions: array with ALL decisions (both VALIDATED and REJECTED)",
    "   • COUNT VERIFICATION: validatedAnomalies + rejectedAnomalies = totalPotentialAnomalies",

    "COUNTING RULE: Count EVERY potential anomaly you receive, regardless of your final decision",
    "MATHEMATICAL EXAMPLE: rating 9.2 vs criteria avg 8.4 (diff 0.8) = VALIDATED as calculation error",
